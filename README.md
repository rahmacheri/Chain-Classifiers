# Chain-Classifier
Chain Classifiers (CC) involve converting the multi-label learning problem into a series of
binary classification problems. Each subsequent binary classifier in the sequence is
constructed based on the predictions made by the preceding classifiers.

 In this approach, three base estimators were employed: the K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN),
which relies on proximity in feature space for classification; Random Forest, known for its
ensemble-based approach and robustness to noise and overfitting SVM as well, famous for its
ability to delineate complex decision boundaries
